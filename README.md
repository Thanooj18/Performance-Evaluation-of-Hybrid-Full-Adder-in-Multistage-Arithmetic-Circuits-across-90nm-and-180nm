This work presents a comprehensive performance analysis of a Hybrid Full 
Adder (TFA) design across 90-nm and 180-nm CMOS technology nodes. The 
TFA circuit is first characterized in terms of delay and average power 
consumption in the single-stage configuration. Subsequently, the TFA is 
utilized to construct two important multistage arithmetic circuits, a 4-bit 
Ripple Carry Adder (RCA) and a 6:2 Compressor. The delay and power 
characteristics of these multistage circuits are also evaluated and compared 
across the 90nm and 180nm technology nodes. Finally, a comparative 
analysis is performed between the 4-bit RCA and 6:2 Compressor to 
understand the tradeoffs in using these different arithmetic building blocks 
in larger system designs. The results provide valuable insights into the 
performance scaling and suitability of the hybrid TFA design for 
implementing efficient multistage arithmetic circuits in scaled CMOS 
technologies.
